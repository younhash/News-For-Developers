## Project Description

I'm creating a News website where developers can look whats happening in the tech space especially in development in other words Software development. Also allowing Developers to search for specific topics. So I'm going to use newsapi.org to get my data and I want to limit it to only software rather than business. 


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.
- Forms
- submit button
- Getting an API response
- Search through an API perhaps limit it to JavaScript and few other technologies
- Getting top 10 news (newest) 
- Div boxes for the headliners or thumbnail
- Event listener to catch the submit
- Links for related resources
- Image banner if not big text with style 


## API Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=13c5993f3cc84e6d81c069e76007ef89


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  


#### MVP 

- Forms with ID
- submit button
- Event listener to catch the submit
- Request to the API
- Getting an API response
- Search through an API perhaps limit it to JavaScript and few other technologies
- Getting top 10 news (newest)
- Output the response to the webpage

#### PostMVP 

- Div boxes for the headliners or thumbnail
- Links for related resources
- Image banner if not big text with style 
- Use local storage to save user favorites


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 1hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Working with API | H | 11hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Event to catch submit | H | 1hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Output the response | H | 1hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Div boxes for headliners | L | 1hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Links for related rosources | L | 1hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Image banner | H | 1hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| HTML and CSS | H | 4hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Total | H | 21hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |


## Code Snippet
